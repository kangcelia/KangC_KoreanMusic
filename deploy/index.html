						                    Musically, the impact of Korean music has been growing rapidly, to the extent that collaborating with Korean artists has become an essential part of the big pop album rollout.
						                    The astonishing rise of Korean music has been one of both artistry and sharp music industry marketing.

									                        Hallyu Wave or Korean Wave was coined by journalists from Beijing and first came out in print in 1999. The Chinese journalists used the term while discussing the phenomenal interest and popularity generated by Korean pop culture and the country’s culture in general. Korean Wave is not just about Korean musical groups and bands. It includes Korean dramas and Korean brands such as LG, Samsung, Hyundai, Kia and others.

									                    <p>
									                        At the same time, K-dramas (Korean dramas) were making inroads into the Chinese market, which started the Korean Wave. Korean dramas also became a hit in Japan, India and several countries in Southeast Asia. Among the first TV dramas that made a big impact was Winter Sonata, followed by Full House.

												                        K-pop followed the footsteps of K-dramas, winning attention and interest among overseas audiences. Among the first performers outside South Korea were solo artist BoA and H.O.T., one of the first South Korean boy bands. The major breakthrough started in 2005, with the debut of boy bands such as Super Junior and SS501. The groups quickly rose to fame, building huge fan bases in many parts of Asia.

												                        The advent of digital technologies, smart phones, video sharing sites and social media allowed the Hallyu Wave to flourish worldwide since 2010. At that time, the music exports of South Korean grew by 168 per cent. It was around that time, as well, when interest in K-drama and K-pop grew in the West. It cannot be denied that the song and video of Psy’s Gangnam Style contributed largely to the worldwide attention on K-pop.
