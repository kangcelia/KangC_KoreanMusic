						                    Musically, the impact of Korean music has been growing rapidly, to the extent that collaborating with Korean artists has become an essential part of the big pop album rollout.
						                    The astonishing rise of Korean music has been one of both artistry and sharp music industry marketing.

									                    Hallyu Wave or Korean Wave was coined by journalists from Beijing and first came out in print in 1999. The Chinese journalists used the term while discussing the phenomenal interest and popularity generated by Korean pop culture and the countryâ€™s culture in general. Korean Wave is not just about Korean musical groups and bands. It includes Korean dramas and Korean brands such as LG, Samsung, Hyundai, Kia and others.

									                    At the same time, K-dramas (Korean dramas) were making inroads into the Chinese market, which started the Korean Wave. Korean dramas also became a hit in Japan, India and several countries in Southeast Asia. Among the first TV dramas that made a big impact was Winter Sonata, followed by Full House.
