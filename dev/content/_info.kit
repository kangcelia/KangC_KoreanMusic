                        K-pop followed the footsteps of K-dramas, winning attention and interest among overseas audiences. Among the first performers outside South Korea were solo artist BoA and H.O.T., one of the first South Korean boy bands. The major breakthrough started in 2005, with the debut of boy bands such as Super Junior and SS501. The groups quickly rose to fame, building huge fan bases in many parts of Asia.

                        The advent of digital technologies, smart phones, video sharing sites and social media allowed the Hallyu Wave to flourish worldwide since 2010. At that time, the music exports of South Korean grew by 168 per cent. It was around that time, as well, when interest in K-drama and K-pop grew in the West. It cannot be denied that the song and video of Psyâ€™s Gangnam Style contributed largely to the worldwide attention on K-pop.
